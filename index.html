      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Hey there, I'm Dnyanesh — a 19 year old from Nagpur, India. I'm interested in the web development, software 
        and IOT.

        I love creating technology that merges utility with thoughtful design. Currently, I'm exploring the relationship
        between technology and society, examining how users interact with and are impacted by tech.

        When I’m free, I like to read. I enjoy trying new things and exploring the abundance of interesting topics the world has to offer.
